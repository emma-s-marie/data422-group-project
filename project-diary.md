## 18/09/2023
We had our first group meeting during the DATA422 lab session. We brainstormed/discussed ideas, and browsed different data sources. We decided to find individual ideas and discuss further later in the week.

## 22/09/2023
We held another group meeting to settle on an idea. Four different ideas were presented: 
1) Looking at pests data in NZ
2) Looking at trail data in NZ
3) Looking at alcohol ban data in NZ
4) Looking at housing prices and crime data in NZ

After discussion, we all agreed to proceed with idea #4.

Emma created the github repository and invited members to join as collaborators.

Emma wrote code in R to scrape this website https://www.police.govt.nz/contact-us/stations/district?field_station_district_value=All&title=&postcodenz=&edit-submit-all-police-stations-new=Go and extract the police stations names and addresses.
