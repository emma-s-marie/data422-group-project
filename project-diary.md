## 18/09/2023
We had our first group meeting during the DATA422 lab session. We brainstormed/discussed ideas, and browsed different data sources. We decided to find individual ideas and discuss further later in the week.

## 22/09/2023
We held another group meeting to settle on an idea. Four different ideas were presented: 
1) Looking at pests data in NZ
2) Looking at trail data in NZ
3) Looking at alcohol ban data in NZ
4) Looking at housing prices and crime data in NZ

After discussion, we all agreed to proceed with idea #4.

Emma created the github repository and invited members to join as collaborators.

Emma wrote code in R to scrape this website https://www.police.govt.nz/contact-us/stations/district?field_station_district_value=All&title=&postcodenz=&edit-submit-all-police-stations-new=Go and extract the police stations names and addresses.

## 25/09/2023

We discussed our project idea in more detail during the DATA422 lab session. Looking more closely at our data and after talking with the TAs, we decided to add additional sources of data, such as the number of school per area.

## 29/09/2023

We had another group meeting and discussed how best to visualise the data. We decided to build an interactive app using R Shiny that allow the user to choose a dataset and display a map (and other graphs) that show the housing prices per region and the number of schools in that region for example.

## 02/10/2023

We explained our project idea to the tutors during the lab. Their comments prompted us to think about our relational data model as well as the data wrangling that will be required for each dataset we have. After discussing this, we collected all of our readily available data and distributed tasks:
- Sarah is responsible for scraping the housing data
- Jacci is reponsible for wrangling the police data
- Levo is responsible for wrangling the school data
- Emma is reponsible for wrangling the population data
